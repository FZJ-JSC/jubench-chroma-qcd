This benchmark is part of the [JUPITER Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jubench). See the repository of the suite for some general remarks.

This repository contains a lattice quantum-chromodynamics (LQCD) benchmark, created by JSC. [`DESCRIPTION.md`](DESCRIPTION.md) contains details for compilation, execution, and evaluation. 

The benchmark relies on the Chroma QCD software system and is heavily supported by the QUDA library for GPU accelerators. The [webpage for Chroma](https://jeffersonlab.github.io/chroma/) contains more detailed information about the package including links to the source [GitHub page](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/chroma).

The provided benchmark runs Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) trajectories for generating lattice gauge field configurations.
